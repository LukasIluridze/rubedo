## Permissions:

As Rubedo is top of the line, permissions and security is at top priority.

### Managing Players permisions

Before you can start managing players permissions you will need to get permission yourself, first time joining the world you will need to run in chat:

```bash
/function start
```

This will Enable you as a `admin` and give you permission to everything in Rubedo

To change permissions simply run this command

```bash
-role set <player: String> <role: "member" | "moderator" | "admin">
```

So for example:

```bash
-role set "Smell of curry" "admin"
```

Its a very simple system and you can manage players permissions with ease
to view permissions simply:

```bash
-role get <player: String>
```

## Commands:

See all commands in game by running **-help** in chat, Please note the permissions
on each command before using it, to manage permissions use `-role set <player: string> <role: "admin" | "moderator" | "member">`

Also Please note that when ever it asks for a player name
that would require you to add spaces use quotes around your agument.
