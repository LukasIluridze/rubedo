## Features

Rubedo is coded in the Brand new Smelly API V4. This API is extremely Powerful it builds and expands all the possibilities making this anti-cheat possible

- Check out [Smelly API](https://github.com/smell-of-curry/Smelly-API)

# Permissions:

As Rubedo is top-of-the-line, permissions and security is our main priority.

### First-time usage

Upon applying the pack and joining the world the operator should run the command below which gives you **Admin** permissions.

$$\color{red} \fcolorbox{red}{white} { THIS CAN ONLY BE RUN ONCE!! THE USER CAN GIVE OTHERS ADMIN PERMS VIA -role} $$

```bash
/function start
```

The command makes the user an `admin` and gives them full access to Rubedo. Ideally, the owner should run this command
### changing a user's permission
To change permissions simply run this command

```bash
-role set <player: String> <role: "member" | "moderator" | "admin" | "builder">
```

So for example:

```bash
-role set "Smell of curry" "admin"
```

It's a very simple system and you can manage player's permissions with ease
to view permissions simply:

```bash
-role get <player: String>
```

## Commands:

See all commands in-game by running **-help** in chat, Please note the permissions
on each command before using it. You can set a users role via  `-role set <player: string> <role: "admin" | "moderator" | "member" | "builder">`

Also Please note that whenever it asks for a player name
that would require you to add spaces use quotes around your argument.

### Get a list of all commands

that a protected region would need.

### Region Permissions

> **Note**: The config.js contains a configurable list of toggles for what
a default region can do

```js
/**
 * The default permissions for all regions made
 */
export const DEFAULT_REGION_PERMISSIONS = {
  /**
   * If players in this region can use doors, trapdoors, and switches like buttons and levers
   */
  doorsAndSwitches: true,
  /**
   * If players in this region can open containers, this is like chests, furnaces, hoppers, etc
   */
  openContainers: true,
  /**
   * If the players in this region can fight each other
   */
  pvp: false,
  /**
   * the entities allowed in this region
   */
  allowedEntitys: ["minecraft:player", "minecraft:npc", "minecraft:item"],
};
```

### Changing the region's permission

**Permissions needed**: `["admin"]`

> **Note**: Running this will automatically change the permission of the
CURRENT region the player is in

```bash
-region permission set <key: doorsAndSwitches | openContainers | pvp> <value: boolean>
```

#### Example

```
-region permission set pvp false
-region permission set openContainers false
-region permission set doorsAndSwitches true
```

```

#### Example

-region permission entities add "minecraft:cow"
-region permission entities remove "minecraft:cow"
```

## Modules:

- **Anti CBE**: Prevents users from using CBE (Commandblock Exploits) which is done by checking the inventory every tick for these illegal items and clearing it.

- **Anti Crasher**: patches a crashing method (typically used by Horion) that teleports a user 30 million blocks far and kicks a user hopefully preventing the crash (USES: player.json)

- **Anti Illegal Enchants**: Checks every player's inventory to see if any item has enchants above the predefined limit set in [enchantment.ts](src/config/enchantments.ts) or via `-config enchantments set "enchantment" value`

- **Anti Fly**:  anti fly works by detecting horizontal velocity, when the user has FLYING_VELOCITY and is not under certain conditions they're considered as flying and, teleports them back to their position

- **Anti Gamemode**: Removes creative and clears the user inventory if the user is not an authorized user.
  > **Note**: **THIS IGNORES BUILDERS**

- **Anti NameSpoof**: Locates invalid Gamertags by comparing them against Xbox's Gamertag requirements and kicking the user out if they fail to meet them.

- **Anti Nuker**: works by logging the placement of blocks done by the player and detects if the next block break is done impossibly fast (50 milliseconds) then we cancel the breaking event.

- **ban bad Blocks/items**: checks if the player has illegal items or if they're placing a banned block and prevents the placement (while the ban list can be controlled via `-config`.

- **Anti Reach**: Detect players who are reaching and automatically cancel that action. This covers reach involving interacting, placing, breaking, and attacking. max reach is set to **7**.
# View Player's inventories & Ender Chests

First, you will need to make sure you have admin permission on your server, look at [Permissions](#permissions) for more details

by typing in chat:

```bash
/give @s `Rubedo:gui`
```

Next to view a list of players click on the ender chest, then you should be
prompted with this screen

![gui screen that shows a list of all players in the world](https://i.ibb.co/QjQXKP0/2Capture.png)

Click a player you want to view, then you will be shown their inventory:

you the item

Once you open up the player's ender chest it should look like this:
